You are given a dataset containing almost 50,000 records about different diamonds including their price.

“Cut” is described from “fair” to “ideal” and reflects the quality of diamond cut.

There are two other categorical properties describing diamonds color and clarity.

Please have a look at 4Cs for diamond valuation to find out more about cut, clarity, color, and carat properties:

The goal of your project is to build a diamond price predictive model.

f (carat, color, clarity, cut, depth, table, x, y, z) —> price

You may use any methods and algorithms that we touched during this course.

You may take the notebook with the diamonds linear regression model from

Week 8 as a starting point of your project.
